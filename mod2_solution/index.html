				<p class="hg">A good maturation is done only with a selection of meat from the best terroirs of Europe and the world, with a predominant criterion: the perwake. These meats are then placed for 21 to 30 days in a cold room reserved for this purpose with a very precise temperature and humidity control.</p>

The chicken (Gallus gallus domesticus) is a type of domesticated fowl, a subspecies of the red junglefowl. It is one of the most common and widespread domestic animals, with a total population of more than 19 billion as of 2011. There are more chickens in the world than any other bird or domesticated fowl.[1] Humans keep chickens primarily as a source of food (consuming both their meat and eggs) and, less commonly, as pets. Originally raised for cockfighting or for special ceremonies, chickens were not kept for food until the Hellenistic period

	<p class="hg">
		Wonderfully addictive, cultural, and artistic -- sushi remains a mystery to the uninitiated. Why would anyone want to pay so much for a few tidbits of raw fish? Unlike the supermarket sushi slopped out by chains in the West, a true sushi experience is unforgettable and difficult to recreate. Masters in Japan know how to make each bite a ride of color, texture, taste, and presentation.
